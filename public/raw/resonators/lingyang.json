        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1888-G]\nResonator Lingyang's age and time of Awakening remain uncertain, and he appears to have Awakened a long time ago. Lingyang has endured prolonged exposure to harsh environmental conditions and may have naturally activated his Forte during combat.\n\nLingyang bears a Tacet Mark on his right arm. No Post-Awakening mutations have been noted.\n\nHis physical endurance and strength are exceptional, likely due to his exposure to extreme environments. He displays advanced skills and agility in combat and survival, but lacks experience utilizing his Forte as it is not habitually used. Further evaluation is necessary to determine if proper guidance in Forte usage is needed.\n\nUnder the influence of his Forte, Lingyang's senses are heightened and he can generate an invisible freezing Gusto within a limited area. This also creates a low-temperature field that exerts pressure on nearby enemies. Additionally, Lingyang can influence and motivate the emotions of those near him through his transmitted will.\n\nNo instances of Resonance Spectrum Patterns similar to Lingyang's have been encountered. The cause of his Awakening remains unknown at this time.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Therefore, Lingyang is identified as a Natural Resonator.\n\n<i>\"What? So his 'beast-like' appearance wasn't a result of his Forte? What exactly is this...\"</i>"
