        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2300-G]\n\nThe Time of Awakening for Resonator Calcharo remains unclear. According to Calcharo's report, he endured extended periods in hostile environments and faced numerous life-threatening situations. As a result, his Forte naturally awakened as a means of self-protection.\n\nResonator Calcharo's Tacet Mark is located on his forehead. When Calcharo activates his Forte, a golden core manifests on his chest. Concurrently, various parts of his body displays characterstics of Tacet Discords, entangled with shadow-like thorns.\n\nNotably, Calcharo's body possesses a significantly higher amount of bioelectrical energy compared to the average human. He demonstrates exceptional awareness of and control over electric currents and magnetic forces.\n\nThe exact cause of Resonator Calcharo's Awakening cannot be identified at the moment, as his Spectrum Pattern does not show similarity to any known samples.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Resonator Calcharo is thereby classified as a Natural Resonator.\n\n\n<i>\"Actually... there is one strikingly similar Spectrum Pattern that we seem to have overlooked, or rather, we hesitated to entertain that possibility.\"</i>\n\n<i>\"Yes... It's the Tacet Discords.\"</i>"
