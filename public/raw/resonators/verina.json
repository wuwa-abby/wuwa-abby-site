        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1916-G]\n\nAccording to Resonator Verina's reports, she has had significant exposure to botanical samples since childhood and is able to audibly detect their frequencies. The timing of her Awakening is unknown.\n\nVerina's resonance frequency shows an increasing trend over time, leading to speculation that her Forte abilities will also continue to strengthen with age. The extent of this growth is still being monitored.\n\nResonator Verina bears a Tacet Mark below her clavicle. Following her Awakening, physical changes have been noted, such as the emergence of vines on both ears and dorsal spine.\n\nThese vines form a symbiotic relationship with Verina and assist in converting her resonance frequency into Spectro energy for efficient storage and release during use of Forte.\n\nAdditionally, Verina's Resonance Spectrum Pattern aligns with known patterns of plant life. Strong Syntony reaction have been recorded during testing, yet the exact cause of Verina's Awakening remains inconclusive.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform. Therefore, Verina is classified as a Congenital Resonator."
