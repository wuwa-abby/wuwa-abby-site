        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1011-G]\n\nThe exact time and cause of Resonator Yangyang's Awakening remain unclear. Resonator Yangyang reports heightened sensitivity to her surroundings since her childhood.\n\nThe Tacet Mark of Resonator Yangyang is located in the center of her forehead. Post-Awakening observations found no notable physical change. As frequency fluctuations resurge, limited feather-like transformation have been observed on the ends of her hair.\n\nResonator Yangyang synchronizes with surrounding air by detecting information in air streams and creating an energy field using converging airflow.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Resonator Yangyang displays over 20% resemblance to that of airflow and smaller bird species. While a strong Syntony reaction is present, the pattern also shares over 5% similarity with multiple other existing samples, indicating potential multiple or contaminating causes of Awakening.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Yangyang is identified as a Natural Resonator."
