        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1425-G]\n\nThe exact time of Resonator Yuanwu's Awakening is unclear. Resonator Yuanwu recounted that he was exposed to powerful electrical energy for extended times before his Awakening.\n\nResonator Yuanwu's Tacet Mark is located on the right side of his neck. After his Awakening, blue crystal-like structures appeared on his front limbs, with scar-like tissue visible on his hands and wrists. These changes have since stabilized.\n\nResonator Yuanwu has extraordinary control over the frequency fluctuations of his body. He can engineer the amplitude and range of his frequencies in an instant, seemingly without doing any harm to himself. Tests have concluded that he is 82.58% more proficient in manipulating frequencies than the average Resonator.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Yuanwu has been observed to align closely with that of thunder. A strong Syntony reaction has been observed, yet the cause of Yuanwu's Awakening remains unclear.\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Resonator Yuanwu is thereby classified as a Natural Resonator."
