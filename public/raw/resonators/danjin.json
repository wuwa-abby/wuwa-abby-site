        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1856-G]\n\nThe exact time of Resonator Danjin's Awakening remains uncertained. Notably, during Resonator Danjin's Awakening event, she exhibited an uncontrollable state of emotional outburst. It is speculated that overwhelming emotions may have catalyzed her awakening.\n\nA Tacet Mark is located on Danjin's upper left arm. Observations have revealed distinct alterations in her physical characteristics after her Awakening. A noteworthy alteration is the reddening of her pupils after exerting her Forte to a certain threshold.\n\nResonator Danjin's frequency fluctuations are stronger than usual, displaying uncommon instantaneous changes that may result in physical damage to her surroundings and any living beings therein when left unhandled.\n\nEmpirical testing has revealed that Danjin's destructive potential surpasses normal people by 78.94%.\nResonance Spectrum Pattern of this Resonator matches that of the human blood. Tests reveal strong Syntony Responses, yet the cause of Danjin's Awakening remains unclear.\n\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in its middle section. Therefore, Danjin is classified as a Mutant Resonator."
