        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2603-G]\n\nResonator Xiangli Yao's awakening occurred two years ago, following an incident at the Jingtian Ruins where he lost his arm and came into contact with an unknown metal substance.\n\nResonator Xiangli Yao's Tacet Mark is located on his prosthetic right arm. Post-Awakening observations revealed his ability to perform Metalmorph by manipulating the shape and stored energy of his prosthetic arm.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Xiangli Yao has been observed to align closely with that of thunder. A strong Syntony reaction has been observed, yet the cause of Xiangli Yao's Awakening remains unclear due to inability to recover samples of the unknown metal substance.  \n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a consistent, flat Rabelle's Curve followed by a sharp ascent and stabilization. Therefore, Xiangli Yao is identified as a Mutant Resonator."
