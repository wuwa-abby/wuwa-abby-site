        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2326-G]\n\nThe precise timing of Resonator Changli's Awakening remains uncertain. Reports indicate that Resonator Changli displayed early signs of fire manipulation during her childhood, often struggling to control it. However, as Changli matured into adulthood, the frequency and stability of these manifestations notably improved.\n\nResonator Changli's Tacet Mark is situated on her lower chest. Post-Awakening examinations have identified specific alterations in her physical attributes. These include a gradual fading of hair color at the tips and feather-like burn marks on her left arm, emitting a fiery glow influenced by her Forte.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Changli mirrors the characteristics of fire, displaying a robust Syntony reaction in testing. Despite the exact trigger for her Awakening remaining uncertain, no other sample with a Resonance Spectrum Pattern similarity exceeding 60% has been identified. Resonator Changli's Forte aligns closely with the mythical spirit bird from Huanglong folklore, possibly influenced by her early immersion in tales related to this legendary creature.\n\nResonator Changli possesses the unique ability to compress flames into delicate feather-shaped projectiles. Her Forte, once unleashed, has the power to create scorching fires of exceptional heat, capable of devastating a large area. A telltale sign that her Forte is active is the emergence of a lone fiery feather with an eye-like pattern on her forehead, which she describes as the \"Mind's Eye.\"\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Changli is identified as a Natural Resonator."
