        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1514-G]\n\nResonator Jianxin experienced her Awakening 3 years ago. The Awakening was not triggered by any event and thus is observed as a Natural Awakening.\n\nResonator Jianxin's Tacet Mark is located on her left shoulder. Post-Awakening observations found no notable physical change.\n\nJianxin's Forte allows her to enhance her attacks by manipulating airflow and creating force fields. Evaluation revealed a strike velocity of 340m/s. Details regarding the force fields remain inconclusive. Overall, Jianxin's Forte exhibits potential for further development.\n\nResonator Jianxin's Resonance Spectrum Pattern has a 5% similarity to over 10 objects and no significant similarities above 20% have been found. The source of Awakening cannot be determined at this time.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Jianxin is identified as a Natural Resonator."
