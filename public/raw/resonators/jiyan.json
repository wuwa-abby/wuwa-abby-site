        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2141-G]\n\nResonator Jiyan's Forte-Awakening was observed at Camp Overwatch located in Desorock Highland. This event was characterized by the accumulation of air currents around his body, forming a distinctive lance.\n\nJiyan bears a distinctive Tacet Mark situated atop his dorsal ridge. Post-Awakening observations found some growths that resemble Loong scale on his left jaw. No indications of progressive expansion have been detected.\n\nResonator Jiyan possesses the ability to manipulate wind energy, which he can channel into a <ano=Teal Dragon>\"Qingloong\"</ano> that aids him in battle. Additionally, he possesses exceptional perception and leadership skills, utilizing his connection to the winds to gather and analyze battlefield information with astonishing accuracy. Empirical testing has shown an impressive accuracy rate of 99.12% in evaluating dynamic situations.\nJiyan's Resonance Spectrum Pattern shows no resemblance to known samples. The cause of his Awakening remains unknown.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in its middle section. Resonator Jiyan is thereby classified as a Mutant Resonator."
