        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1631-G]\nThe exact time of Resonator Encore's Awakening remains uncertain. According to Encore's reports and resonance inspection, the sheep-like entities that accompany her are considered to be manifestations of her imagination and psychological state. They are believed to represent her Forte abilities.\n\nEncore's Resonance Assessment was found to be influenced by the collective emotion in the testing environment, exhibiting a strong Syntony response. The cause of her Awakening remains unconfirmed.\n\nEncore bears a Tacet Mark on her upper back, and Post-Awakening examinations have revealed minor physical mutations, including wool-like hair tips. In times of heightened emotional states, she may also manifest sheep-like horns, requiring caution from testing personnel.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform, which classifies Encore as a Congenital Resonator."
