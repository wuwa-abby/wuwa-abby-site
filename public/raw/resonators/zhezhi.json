        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1231-G]\n\nThe exact timing of Resonator Zhezhi's Awakening is unclear. Signs of \"animation\" appeared in her childhood drawings, and her Forte control improved alongside her painting skills.\n\nResonator Zhezhi's Tacet Mark is located on the back of her right hand. Post-Awakening observations have not found any significant physical changes. Testing shows Zhezhi can \"animate\" her paintings, affecting observers' visual perception and judgment (effective on both living organisms and Tacet Discords).\n \n\"Animation\" has two levels:\nModerate: Causes slight movements in two-dimensional images.\nSevere: Simulates three-dimensional volumetric forms, lasting up to 30 minutes and 28 seconds, covering up to 274.5 square meters.\n\nBoth levels produce illusions, not actual objects. No stable interval detected.\n\nNo similar Resonance Spectrum Pattern identified, and the cause of Zhezhi's Awakening remains unclear.\nAdditionally, analysis of test samples show a Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform. Therefore, Zhezhi is identified as a Congenital Resonator."
