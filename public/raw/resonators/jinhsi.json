        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2100-G] \n\nThe exact timing of Resonator Jinhsi's Awakening remains unclear. Signs of her Awakening manifested early in her life, establishing a profound resonance with Sentinel Jué. \n\nPositioned at the midpoint of her back, Jinhsi's Tacet Mark is a distinct feature. When activating her Resonance Ability, crystalline formations resembling Loong horns materialize above her head. \n\nThrough her unique gift, Jinhsi can manipulate light to create holographic projections mirroring Sentinel Jué, showcasing power comparable to the Sentinel's own abilities.\n\nObservational data points towards the exceptional growth capacity of the subject's Resonance Ability. The pinnacle of this ability hints at the remarkable prospect of time shifting.\n\nDetailed analysis of Jinhsi's Resonance Spectrum Pattern has unveiled a striking resemblance to that of Sentinel Jué. Rigorous testing has uncovered strong Syntony reactions. Nevertheless, the precise trigger behind Jinhsi's Awakening remains enigmatic due to the Sentinel's special position.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform, which classifies Jinhsi as a Congenital Resonator."
