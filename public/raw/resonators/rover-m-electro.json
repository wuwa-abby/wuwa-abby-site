        "description": "No family history of resonance, significant structural variation in gene sequence, Resonance Chain functionally intact and clearly expressed, secondary variation suspected in some bands. Identified as a self-conscious Resonator. \n\nSmall leafy blue crystals attached to the body surface, stable in nature, no risk of continued mutation for the time being, but continued observation is required given the exceedingly high level of Wuthering Waves subs in the crystals. \n\nThe subject's Forte force is overall stable, and the subject is quite proficient at manipulating the Forte force. The reported pain associated with its use is suspected to be a projection of the subject's mental state."
