        "description": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2893-G]\n\nResonator Chixia experienced her Awakening 6 years ago after being exposed to extreme temperatures and blazing flames.\n\nResonator Chixia's Tacet Mark is located in her lower left abdomen. Post-Awakening observations found a change in hair color to red and a significant increase in body temperature.\n\nShe is capable of converting the frequencies of high-temperature substances into tangible flame ammunitions. \nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Chixia has been observed to align closely with that of flames. A strong Syntony reaction has been observed, yet the cause of Chixia's Awakening remains unclear.\n\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in the middle section. Resonator Chixia is thereby classified as a Mutant Resonator."
